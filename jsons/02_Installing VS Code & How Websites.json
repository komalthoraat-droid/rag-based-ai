A lot of technologies have come which will make your work very easy. This course will be for those who don't know anything. You know that it is zero for you if you know about web development. We will start from zero but we will raise the bar like anything. What will we learn in this course? I will tell you in a few days. Web development is a very profitable thing. I have personally earned a lot of money through web development. And I believe that you can also be very successful by learning web development. During the course, you will get notes, cheat sheets, references, all these things. This course is going to be a little different because in this course, I will tell you the technologies that you should learn as much as possible according to your experience. And I will make this course a complete course with all the web development technologies. There will be course content, complete web development, front end, back end, database. I will teach you as much as you want to learn. I will tell you the course content in a few days. But you guys keep in mind that you will be a full stack developer. In the future, you will be given a lot of projects during the course. And in the end of the course, we will make some good projects so that you can be very strong on web development. According to me, project based learning is the best way to learn. So I will make you a lot of projects. And if you agree, then write it in the comment section below. I agree because when you comment, my face gets a smile. So do comment. I want to make you believe that after finishing this course, you can make any kind of website from the beginning to the end. And during this course, I will make you a lot of websites so that your confidence will go up a lot. So let's start with the first video of our Sigma web development course. Let's roll the intro. I have come to my computer screen. And now as I am doing, you guys follow me. I have downloaded Google Chrome browser here. You also download Google Chrome browser. I am not saying that it won't work. But you guys have to do exactly what I am doing here. So here we will follow you as I am doing. And along with that, you will be able to follow the videos as you come. I will go to Google and I will write down the download VS Code. Now what is VS Code? VS Code is a source code editor. If you are in Windows, then I will click on Windows. If you are in Mac, Linux or any other operating system, then you can download it for that strange operating system. And the process is exactly the same. You can see that my downloads folder is here. And as you can see here, the setup has been downloaded. I will refresh here. And look here, I can double click on the setup of VS Code and install. So, I am simply installing VS Code. It is as easy as installing a game here. So, you can quickly agree here. This lies and upslies. Toad, dood dood dood. Damages. And after that, I will accept the agreement and accept. You can read it like me. And I am the fastest reader in the world. Oh my God! oh my God! Next, next, next. It's important to check both the icons. It's very important to check. If you want a desktop shortcut, that means if you want to get a shortcut in desktop, then create a desktop icon. Next, install. If your PC is fast like mine, then it will be fast. But if your PC is slow, then it's not a problem. It will be a little slow. Nothing more. I will recommend you to subscribe to the channel. Because I want you to follow these videos. Like I have given you the notification. If you want to follow this course completely, ideally you should subscribe. With that said, our VS code is downloaded. I have opened my VS code. Don't be afraid of this. I am saying this again. If you know something already, we are starting with beginner friendly. We are starting with the initial videos. But we will raise the bar like anything in the upcoming videos. So stay tuned. I will also request you to tell me what is your level in the comments section. Are you a beginner, advanced or intermediate user? In the comments section, tell me where does web development come from? Beginner, advanced, intermediate. Please do comment this. Now what is VS code here? Why have you downloaded it? If you don't know what is VS code, let me tell you that VS code is a code editor that helps you to edit code. Now you can edit the code in the notepad. So yes, do it in the notepad. Yes, I am not doing it in the sarcastic way. Let's set it up here. Let me show you what is in it. Which makes it a little different from notepads. Let's set it up here. I will not do the color themes here. I will do it. I will keep the theme dark and I have done all this. Next section. You can also close the welcome. But first, I am telling you some tips. That's it. The VS code here has started. This is the VS code screen. You can make your own file or folder. But I will recommend you to close it. Yes, you can close it. Why did you close it? I am going to make a new folder here. I will name it. You guessed it right. Sigma web development course. We will do everything in this course. We will do everything. We will do everything related to the course. We will do nothing more. If you will shift here and do it rightly. You can see here. There is an option called open with code. This option is called open with code. This particular folder helps you open it in the VS code. You will select it. Now what you will do here? You will say yes, I trust this file. Click on this and authorize the yes, I trust this. Now the folder is open. If I click on plus, I will write index.html. If you don't know what I am writing. Write enter. And after that, I will write here. Hey, I am your first HTML file. I wrote this. Here you can see the white color of the bindu. This is the bindu. You haven't saved this file. Save it by doing it. I will recommend you to go to the file. And enable the auto save option. As soon as you type it, you won't see this bindu. Your file will instantly be saved. I recommend this. We won't use control s. Otherwise, if you want to save it with control s, you can disable this option. I would like you to click on gear. Click on settings. And search here mouse. mouse. Now you can see here editor mouse wheel zoom. I will tell you what will happen if you check it. Just close it by checking it. You don't have to be scared at all. Why is VS code? What is this? You don't have to see this. You will simply scroll by pressing control. Your font size changes. I will show you a magic. It is very simple logic. In downloads, in the folder called sigma web development course, what happened? This file was created. index.html Which is very natural. I have opened this folder in VS code. I have opened this folder in VS code. This file is also created here. I will make another file here. I will make this file from this.txt. This is this. This file will also be created here. This folder and VS code are both in sync. If I open this file from here, I will show you. This is my file. I can do it. But I will not use notepad. There are some things in VS code that don't give me notepad. And I want to get those features. I don't want to overrun you. But I will show you. What is this in VS code that you don't get in notepad? If I write here. Hit html. If I hit enter, it automatically gives me the opening closing tag. If I hit exclamation mark here, it gives me a boilerplate template. I will click on it. The basic code of this html is here. We will discuss about it later. Don't overrun it. But I want to tell you what is the benefit of VS code. Why we didn't use notepad or VS code. And this feels. The good feeling is coming to us. The feeling of the developer. That feeling is also important. Then there will be a convenience to do coding. For Mac and Linux users, I want to comment on something exactly similar. For you people. I am using Windows laptop. I can't use it in 3 laptops. Linux, Mac and Windows 3. I can't use it in 1 or 2. So exactly the same things will be for you. In fact, I should say similar things. Exactly the same things will be very similar. So you can follow along very easily. So don't worry. I will tell you about some extensions. You will enjoy it in a while. You will use those extensions and you will say. It was fun. What did you recommend? This is criminally underrated. I am telling you that you will enjoy it. I want to tell you about that too. You will right click on command palette. There are many options for VS code. You don't need to know all these options. As we will move forward in the course. The features. As it will come in use. I will tell you about it. And you will use it. But what I will do here. I will toggle the screencast mode. You don't have to do this. You will know it. I clicked it. I will type any type. If I click caps lock. You will know when I clicked it. This is not relevant for you. But I just want to tell you. Screencast mode. Screencast mode. We can change the settings from here. Here you see the vertical offset of screencast mode. What does vertical offset mean? If I set vertical offset to 0. It came up. If I set vertical offset to 70. It came down. I will set it to 60. If I set it to 80. It came up. From bottom. It will come up. I have set it to 0. I will type any type. It will come up. I will close the settings tab. This is tab. It is a Chrome tab. It is exactly the same. I hope you have understood. What is it? I forgot about it. I will tell you step by step. What is it? You can close the page of VS Code. If you want to zoom in VS Code. I will do it. I am recording video. Add control plus. I am doing it because I am recording videos. Ideally I want you to see it from the side. But when I am doing my coding. I don't zoom in that much. You have to keep this in mind. These are related to VS Code. I want to tell you how websites work. A website basically. Works through 3 types of people. Imagine 3 types of people. One is Client. One is Server. Who is Client? Second one is Server. Third one is Browser. Who is called as Babu. Browser. Browser, Client, Server. What is Client? Client who I am? You, all of us. Who is the browser? This is Chrome. I am Client. I will tell you from Client. When I write code with Harry. I am basically saying I am saying from this browser that by doing this give me code with Harry. Or if I write here youtube.com I am saying give me youtube.com website. I am saying browser give me youtube.com I want youtube. Browser says you want youtube. Here. I will enter youtube.com. So from server bring youtube.com. Do you understand? From server he passed this and showed me this screen. This work happened so fast. Because my internet.com internet speed is fast. It is so low nowadays. People are faster. But still according to my locality it is very fast. With this fast internet speed all these things are very fast. So Client server sends a request through browser. Browser is my assistant. I will do the same with browser. He will help me. From server to bring this webpage. Who is the server? He is managing the server. And there is a code in the server which sends me this kind of code. When I write youtube.com this code came. Now how to convert this code this is for browser. I have to show this to browser. So Client browser says give me youtube.com Browser says you want youtube.com. I will ask youtube.com Then browser goes to server. He gives me youtube.com He will give me youtube.com He will give me server. He will say there is no here. He will say error. He will say server error. Whatever the response is ideally it should be 200. With that response our browser comes back to client. And shows this kind of page. I hope you have cleared this. Client browser comes back to client. This is a little more important thing. When you write google.com any website google.com So Client browser says give me google.com Browser says I want google.com Wait I will give you server. So browser goes to server and google.com comes back to you. Now with google.com all the images, videos, all the things are sent. These icons are sent. The URL is also in this code. And that too is the browser's work. We display it correctly. The server sends the browser a bundle. This kind of bundle. Passing this bundle and showing it like this is the work of the browser. Now with the user interaction the browser will give additional request. If I write and inspect and then go to network. And here I write Harry brother. I wrote Harry brother. So many requests are sent for images. And also many requests are sent. So as soon as you interact and send additional request to the browser. So by combining the cool you can understand it like a restaurant. You have given order. You have given order. A waiter took your order. He went to the kitchen. He sent your order to the kitchen. You can understand the kitchen as a server. And finally when the kitchen gave the order What did this waiter do? He saw the waiter and he gave you the order. It is possible that he can't make it in the order kitchen for some reason. It is very less that you order something and you didn't get it. But sometimes it happens. Similarly here also sometimes it happens. You get the error. You get the error. But ideally 200 is the response. And you get this kind of web page. So you can understand it like a restaurant. So whenever you write google.com.slashmail you will see it. And if you write codewithary.com.slashcontact you will see it. If it is not available you will see it. If it is 500 error you will see a 500 page. You will see whatever server you send So this cycle is going on. The client sent the request. The browser sent the server. The server processed the request. After that the server sent the data back and the browser sent the data back. Then the client did something. The browser sent the same request to the server. Then the server sent something. The server sent the data back to the client. And so on. So now you will understand it. But what is backend? Backend is how the server is processing the request. If you have a blog with a lot of data then what you will do? You will store every web page of the blog or you will generate that content dynamically. You will generate that content dynamically. I will take an example of Google. If I search Harry by you can see here that the Google header these are the links. This format does not change at all. If I write here Shubham I have written Shubham here. So as soon as I write Shubham when I wrote Harry by I am showing a similar content of it. So what does Google do? The backend of the Google server. The backend processes the data in a way that it can send such HTML for corresponding query. When I write Shubham I write this. When I write Harry I write this. The process of generating this is the same as the system. Now this backend can be Jango. This backend can be Flask. This backend can be Node. This backend can be PHP. This backend can be Ruby on Rails. The backend code is not visible to the client. This is the front end code that the server sends. And how did the server make this code? We do not know that. Because this is running on the server. If you are confused then do not be confused. You will understand all these things. We will see the backend ahead. Now we understand how the front end works. The front end is made primarily with three languages. HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the three languages which you can make any website. Each website needs HTML, CSS, JavaScript in most of the cases. If you use only HTML then it is a basic skeleton of the website. After that when you use CSS you can style it. The way this button looks like this is only the result of CSS. Along with that, here this button is red. This button looks like this. This is the support of CSS. Here you can see the edges. This is the support of CSS. This is the work of CSS. What is the color of the button? What will be the color of the word? All these works are done through CSS. This is the beauty of CSS. HTML is the base of any page. HTML is the base of any page. This is a standard. If anyone makes a website then it will be made on HTML. So that the browser can understand how to parse it. The work of the browser is to parse HTML. And HTML is a skeleton. This is a standard. Anyone who makes a website in this world will use a skeleton in HTML. This is a standard. This is a standard so that everyone makes the same type of pages. And if someone is making a browser then you have to parse the same language. If you have learnt 80% HTML then you are good to go for web development. Now there are some things directly from HTML. For example, if I write a lot of HTML codes then I am writing HTML codes like this. I have written the exclamation mark and I have used the emitter abbreviation. Don't worry about this code. I will write this as HTML. And I can open this HTML file directly. And as soon as I open this HTML file directly you will see that it will open like this. I can open it directly by double clicking. And it opened. This is HTML but it is not styled. This HTML file is very basic. You can run videos directly from this HTML file. I have an HTML file which I will show you. You can run videos from this. I will change this HTML file and show you. So that we can show videos in this. So there is a video tag in HTML. If we enter the video then the video you will put in SRC will be played. For example, if I put video1.mp4 here then you see that the video1.mp4 is automatically shown by VS Code. This is the benefit of using VS Code. So you can see here that I will reload it. And this video is automatically shown. I can play it. To play it I will have to write controls here. And I will refresh it. So I will have controls to play it. I can play it. This is a permission. For selling it, people need it. How much do you want? 130 crores is asking for it. Final. Now if I put video2.mp4 here. I have put video1 here. I have two more videos. If I put it here. And after that I will refer to them. If I put video2.mp4 here. Then you will see video2. I will reload it and show you. So if you have put the video. Then you can help me and show people. What is the big deal? These were the looks of Ben Stokes. Now if I do video3 here. Suppose I do video3 here. So my third video will be there. So I will reload it. And you see I can play it. So this is the third video. I have put video3.mp4 here. So I will close it. And we can play video4 too. And I have video4. And I have video4. Where DJ is playing. So you see. So you can make such things. You can use it. You don't need to do anything else. You can play videos with only HTML. You can display images. You can play with only HTML. Now if you want to style it. Suppose I want a border. Or a red background. Then what I will have to do for that. I will have to use CSS. CSS adds beauty to any website. Then comes JavaScript. Which adds interaction to a website. For example. I will write code with HR. When I will write code with HR. When I will write code with HR. And here I have auto complete. Why did I write this. Because there was a request on the server. And for this query. The results of auto complete came here. So these are all things from JavaScript. This is called client side scripting. I mean. If we want to do scripting in client. If we want to do coding. We can do it on the client side. With the help of code. This is also called brain. So our website becomes beauty with brain. I am talking about website. Beauty with brain. CSS adds beauty. And brain came from JavaScript. Now JavaScript helps you to make the page dynamic. For example. If you want to change the content. Then all this is done with JavaScript. There are many mosquitoes here. So I will kill these mosquitoes. Oh my God. Like the video. Because I eat the current chetkis for you. So when I was in college. I was shocked. That I have to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript. First learn 100% HTML. Then learn 100% CSS. Until I remember all the properties. Then learn JavaScript. But this expression is wrong. Why is it wrong. Because HTML is 80%. And CSS is 40% to 60%. And JavaScript. And you can learn it. From there you can move forward. In the next course. I will tell you about chat gpt and web development. So we will discuss about this. You stay tuned. So don't run after perfection. Take HTML and CSS. Don't think that I will do HTML for a year. I will do CSS for the next year. Then I will do JavaScript for the next 3 years. Then I will make projects for the next 4 years. Don't think that. HTML 80%. Learn 70% And you can make a great website. And as you keep making websites. Your experience will teach you more HTML. More CSS. And you won't know that you have perfected HTML, CSS, JavaScript. While you are making money. And working as a professional web developer. So you will be earning with learning. And you will be moving forward with your skills. So don't think that I will remember all the HTML tags. Then I will make a website. Then I will make all the CSS properties. Then I will make all the JavaScript. Then I will make all the JavaScript. Then I will make the website. I will teach you this much. I will teach you that much. You will learn what matters. And I don't want you to learn for years. So I designed this course. So that you can learn only what matters. And the rest you will learn from practice. And in many practices I will make you do it. Here we have 2-4 mosquitoes to learn the Sigma Web Development course. Which is good. Our audience is increasing. In this course we will learn HTML first. And I will tell you such tricks in this course. Which you will not have heard anywhere. And I have learnt different points about my career. I will tell you about it in this course. I have learnt some very awesome tricks in my career. I have learnt some very awesome tricks in my career. And I want you to learn all the tricks. And I want you to learn all the tricks. Now if you have any doubt in this course. In the coming videos. You can use the hashtag doubt. And ask your doubt. I am going to try to answer all the doubts. I will try. So that the doubts can be solved. So if you have any question. Use the hashtag doubt. Please don't use the hashtag doubt. In the comments. Write it without the hashtag doubt. So that I can prioritize the comments. I will try to answer all the doubts. As much as I can. And you will learn everything in this course. So like this course. If you haven't done it yet. That will bring a smile on my face. So do it. What is next. So these front end frameworks. They help you to use JavaScript. They help you to use JavaScript. HTML, CSS, JavaScript are websites. They help you to make this process faster. How? We will learn this in this course. Yes. We will learn in this course. I told you. I will make this course. I will make you. I will take you from zero to hero. Take your seat. Because you have taken the ticket. For web development express. I want to give you a good analogy. To learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript. HTML is like car skeleton. If you paint it. And if you put it in internal engine car. Then it is JavaScript. As an example. Skeleton is HTML. Then skin is everything. CSS and brain is everything. The nervous system is JavaScript. Now I will take you to phobes.com. As soon as you go to phobes.com. Then you will see a website. And phobes.com is a website. Which uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Like any other website. If I click on right click. Click on inspect. Then the inspect element is opened. Now you see here. They have used script in the head. And to add CSS here. They have used link. So what I will do here. I will remove their CSS. To remove it. I will clear all their style tags. By using delete key. As soon as I remove all the style tags. And as soon as I remove all the link tags. As soon as I have read all their style sheets. See what the condition of this page is. This page is showing something like this. It is only raw HTML. What size should be. How should be the images. All this is forgotten. And only raw HTML is written here. Which is not styled at all. Without CSS. This is only showing raw buttons. Showing raw text. Showing raw links. And similarly. I can remove the script tag. To see without JavaScript. If I delete the HTML tag. Like this. I have deleted all the head. I have deleted all the head. So this is a blank page. Without HTML. This is the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I want to tell you that this course was initially made to be paid. But I changed my mode. And converted it to free course. I thought I will put it on YouTube. So I want you all to be serious. Many people have reached out to me. To launch paid course. But I was getting a voice from the heart. I should keep this course free. Because when I learnt web development. I can understand when you don't have a course. To learn well. And you don't have the affordability to buy a paid course. I can understand. To launch it. This course is free. But it is free. As you earn crores in the coming time. You can give me tea, coffee, parties. And all the gifts. This is our agreement in this video. So when you earn crores. And after this course. Send me a green leaf. Or red leaf. But you have to accept. When you start earning well. So I will tell you in the next video. To complete the course. I will put light on it. Come on. How will you earn money. How do I freelancing. How do clients come. I will tell you everything. I want to tell you some action items. The first action item. You can access the playlist. I will give you the description. Everyone bookmark the playlist. Press the star button. And then click on the star button. Many people said. We will buy the course. Thank you so much for all the support. I trust you. I am very proud of you. But this course is going to be free. No technical issues should come. I am putting these videos in the resolution of 1080p. So you should see it clearly. But all those people say. That the video is in SD. It is in 240p. You see the value of your mobile. You finish your internet. You watch it. And you ask me. Call a Nagarpali. I hope you understand the request. The response. How do these websites work. We got a basic idea. How do client-server interactions work. In the upcoming videos. We will see how the website is made. We are going to make our first website in the next video. So you should be excited. Because in the next video. Our first website is going to be made. So you should be excited. So access the playlist. Thank you so much guys for watching this video. And I will see you next time. ."
