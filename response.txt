Hello there! I'd be happy to help you with your question about CSS.

From what I understand, you're looking for information on where and how much content is taught about CSS in a specific video of your Sigma Web Development course. Is that correct?

If so, based on the video subtitle chunks you provided earlier, it seems like there are three main topics covered: "Your First HTML Website", "Heading, Paragraphs and Links", and "Basic Structure of an HTML Website".

For example, in Video 2, around timestamp 325.78 seconds, you're taught about a Style.css file and how to link it to your index.html file. Additionally, at timestamp 917.78 seconds, you'll learn more about the concept of CSS and its importance.

Similarly, in Video 3, around timestamp 91.6 seconds, you'll be introduced to the main files used in HTML websites (index.html, main.css, style.css, and script.js).

Lastly, in Video 3 as well, from 219.08 to 229.28 seconds, you'll learn about the background of CSS.

If your question is more specific or related to a particular topic within these videos, I'd be happy to try and assist you further!
