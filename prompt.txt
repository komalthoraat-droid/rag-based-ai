I am teaching web development in my sigma web development course.here are video subtitle chunks containing video title,video number,start time in seconds,end time in seconds,the text at that time:

[{"title":"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML","number":"5","start":158.0,"end":170.0,"text":" Save it in video 5.  Okay, I saved it in the name of image.  Now, there is an IMG tag in HTML.  The way you will put it, SRC and Alt are required attributes.  In fact, if you don't write Alt, then it will work."},{"title":"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML","number":"5","start":359.0,"end":369.0,"text":" In fact, you can use style attribute  with almost all tags.  So, this was about the image.  Now, we will talk about the tables in HTML.  In HTML, table tag is very useful."},{"title":"Basic Structure of an HTML Website","number":"3","start":377.88,"end":388.68,"text":" So the script tag that you can add to the body,  you can also add it to the top.  And what difference will we talk about in the course?  But you can see here,  I used the link and added CSS again."},{"title":"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML","number":"5","start":113.0,"end":121.0,"text":" So, we will bring train key images.  Why will we bring any other image?  I will do the same images.  And here, in the video number 5 folder of Sigma Web Development Course,  this is a CMS file."},{"title":"Image, Lists, and Tables in HTML","number":"5","start":47.0,"end":63.0,"text":" Now, the first thing I will tell you is about the image.  What is the image in HTML?  We will make a folder here.  In the name of Video 5, click on the new folder and here Video 5.  You know, I have already told you about the open with code."}]

"where is image tag taught in this course"
user asked this question related to the video chunks,you have to answer in a human way(dont mention the above format it just for you) where and how much content is tought in which video(in which video and at what timestamp)and guide the user to go to that particular video.if user asks unrelated questions,tell him that you  can only answer questions related to the course
